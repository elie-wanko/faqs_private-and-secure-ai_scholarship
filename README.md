## Why we created this repo?
All the channels of our Slack community are constantly buzzing with great questions and amazing answers. These answers can be in the form of lucid explanations from our peers or references to some awesome resources. But due to a limitation in free plan of Slack, we can search only upto the last 10K messages. Due to this limitation, we are loosing the efforts of our peers and all the amazing resources. To prevent this loss of invaluable resources, we have created this repo where we would be regularly be adding frequently asked questions and the possible solutions shared by our peers in the Slack channels. Also, this repo would help future students of this course as they would find solutions to most of the common problems in a single repo.

We hope to make this repo useful not only for the students of "Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge with Facebook" but also for future students of [Secure and Private AI course](https://www.udacity.com/course/secure-and-private-ai--ud185) by Facebook AI on Udacity.
